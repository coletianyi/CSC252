Problem 1
The database schema consists of 4 relations, whose schemas are:
Product(maker, model, type)
PC(model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop(model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer(model, color, type, price) 

The product relation gives the manufacturer, model number and type(PC, Laptop, or printer) of various products.
We assume for convenience that model numbers are unique over all manufacturers and product types; the
assumption is not realistic and a real database would include a code for the manufacturer as part of the model
number. The PC relation gives for each model number that is a PC the speed, RAM, size of hard disk and price.
The laptop relation is similar, The printer relation records for each printer model whether the printer produces
color output, the process type and price.
Write the following declarations:
a) A suitable schema for relation Product
b) A suitable schema for relation PC
c) A suitable schema for relation Printer
d) An alteration of your printer schema from (c) to delete the attribute color
e) An alteration to your Lap
